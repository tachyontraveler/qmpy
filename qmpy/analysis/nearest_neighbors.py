def find_nearest_neighbors(structure, method='closest', limit=5, tol=2e-1,
        **kwargs):
    """
    For each atom in the `structure` assign the nearest neighbors.

    Keyword Arguments:
        method ('closest' or 'voronoi'):
            closest: 
                Atoms A and B are neighbors, if and only if there is no atom C 
                such that AC < AB and BC < AB. Once all pairs of this kind 
                have been assigned, the nearest neighbors are those within 
                `tol` of the shortest distance.

            voronoi: 
                Assign nearest neighbors based on voronoi construction.
                For each atom which generates a voronoi facet, `tol` specifies
                the minimum area of the facet before the atom is considered a
                nearest neighbor.

            defaults to 'closest'

        limit:
            Range outside of the unit cell that will be searched for nearest
            neighbor atoms.

        tol: Varied depending on the method being used.

    Returns:
        dict of Atom:list of Atom pairs. For each atom in the structure, its
        "neighbors" attribute will be set to the list of its nearest neighbors.

    .. Note:: Recommended to use the "closest" method unless you are sure you
              what the "voronoi" method will do. The voronoi neighbors are
              useful for some purposes, but are often not what are normally
              considered nearest neighbors. For example in BCC the second
              nearsest neighbors contribute to facets in the an atoms voronoi
              cell. The tolerance specification for this method sets the
              minimum area of such a facet required to add the atom as a
              nearest neighbor. In the BCC case, this cutoff must be set to at
              least 2.3 A^2 to exclude the facets due to second nearest
              neighbors.
