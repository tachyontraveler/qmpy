<h1> OQMD API </h1>
<p>
OQMD now supports REpresentational State Transfer (REST) API based, fully open data transfer from our servers to the users around the world. 
The RESTful system allows a user to access the OQMD.org to search, filter and download data without having to download the entire SQL database or even without using a browser or any additional software packages at the user-end.
All it needs is a simple, general file retrieval system (eg: wget) and all the data filter constraints are passed from the user to the server via the URL of file request.
At this time, we support a native OQMD RESTful specification based on conventional qmpy data keywords, and the <a href="http://www.optimade.org/">OPTiMaDe</a> RESTful specification - A detailed description of all these is provided in the <a href="{% static "docs/restful.html" %}"> RESTful Documentation page</a>.

The data is availed without requiring any user credentials. So usage of a specific Python query package is optional, but nevertheless a standalone <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qmpy-rester/">Querying System</a> is provided for convenience of the frequent users.

<h2> Implemented RESTful APIs  </h2>
<p>
The following links are the endpoints for the user's preferred RESTful query specification. By default, these endpoints list the paginated OQMD data without applying any filters.
