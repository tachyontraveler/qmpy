1. **Where are the input structures?**
    *Because we have an agreement with the ICSD, we are unable to provide the original structures. 
    We provide the ICSD collection code number instead, so that anyone with access to the ICSD can 
    obtain the original structure.*

2. **Where are the references for the experimental formation energy values?**
    *These values were collected from multiple sources as detailed here in* [Kirklin2015]_. *Specific source for an individual experimental formation energy value may be obtained from a locally hosted qmdb-SQL-database by querying for "qmpy.ExptFormationEnergy" objects*
